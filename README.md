# Movie Searcher Vidly

Heroku url: https://quiet-escarpment-48437.herokuapp.com/

This project was made as a learning experience, simulating a movie searcher. By logging in, the user is given more permissions, having the ability to add movies to a database. To do this project I used React, with it's component based functionality adding a lot of flexibility and reusability. For the backend Node.js was used.

I created this project by following along with Code With Mosh's tutorial series, learning a lot about react in the process. I am planning on doing a follow up project using React for a business idea.

Here is my certificate, showcasing my proof of completion of the course:
